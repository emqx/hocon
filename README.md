### Divergence from Spec and Caveats

- No unicode support (at least not verified).
- The forbidden character `@` is allowed in unquoted strings.
- Value concatenation is not allowed in keys e.g. `a b c : 42` is invalid.
- `url()/file()/classpath()` includes are not supported

## Test Data

Files in sample-configs are collected from https://github.com/lightbend/config/tree/v1.4.1
